   <h2> CHAPTER 1:DID YOU SAY SOMETHING, MIJA? </h2>
   <p>I screamed. I said that I would scream. I warned him before that I would.</p>
   <p>"Mija, what is going on in here?" comes from the door before it is flung wide open. </p>
   <p>"Daaad," I whined, hoping it would make him go away faster.</p>
   <p>"What happened, Mia?" he pressed. "Are you alright?" "Did you hurt yourself?" "Are you hurt?"</p>
   <p>"Dad," I said again, "I'm <i>fiiine</i>.Seriously. I'm okay." He did not look convinced.</p>
   <p>"I'm not convinced," he said.</p>
   <p><i>Ayayay. What am I gonna do with you, dad?</i></p>
   <p>"Well," I started,"Why not?"</p>
   <p>He squinted his eyes at me, then slapped his hand over his face, shaking his head. He said, "You shriek like the devil, mija. Half of the neighbors must be awake. I know that their dogs are."</p>
   <p>"Yeah, right," I told him. I walked away from my closet and over to my bed, diving unto it. "Those dogs never sleep. They might as well be zombies. I'm sure they'd eat my brain if I let them."</p>
   <p>He sighed. "Not the point here, Mia. Why did you scream?"</p>
   <p>I rolled my eyes back.I braced myself up against the wooden headboard, and pulled my sneakers off. After tossing them off of the bed, I pointed up to a top corner of my room.</p>
   <p>"Are you serious, Mija?"</p>
   <p>I grinned sheepishly at him. "Get rid of it, please?"</p>
   <p>He left the room and came back with a trash-bin and a broom, and went to work.</p>
   <p>"The spider's gone now. Try to get some sleep," he said to me as he made his way to the door. "Good Night, mija. I love you."</p>
   <p>"I love you too, dad. Can you get my light before you leave?"</p>
   <p>"Sure thing," he said."No more screaming, okay?"</p>
   <p>"I make no promises," I told him.</p>
   <p>I watched as he shook his head and switched the light off. I heard the door get shut behind him.</p>
   <p>The room stayed deadly quiet. I spoke out loud, "Told you I was gonna scream."</p>
   <p>"Haha, hilarious," responds the voice from the closet.</p>
   <p>"Next time you leave your body parts lying around on my bed I will beat you back to life with them, understood?"</p>
   <p>"If you say so, dear," says my Undead Boyfriend.</p>
