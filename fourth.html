   <h2> CHAPTER 1: DANCING FOR DEATH </h2>
   <p> I was scared. I'll admit that. Today hadn't been the best day but tonight is one hundred times worse.  </p>
   <p>"You should have stayed at home," I think as I try to scrub sand out of my eye. Have you ever had sand in your eyes? At first it feels like there's a porcupine rolling around on your cornea, and it turns into said porcupine getting stuck to the back of your eyelid and dragged across your eye as you knead your knuckles trying to get the dust out.</p>
   <p>Why is there <i>sand</i> in my eye, you ask? It's quite simple really. I was face down, peachy bum up in the street that the construction workers seemed to have forgotten about.</p>
   <p>I leaned against the piss stink, brick wall until I was standing on my feet.</p>
   <p>"Frickity Frack," I spat out along with a small piece of my tooth. </p>
   <p>I willed myself to the end of the red path, stumbling along the way. My knees bruised and weak. My legs displaced and quaking.</p>
   <p>"Ooomph," is forced out of my mouth as I trip over my feet and I fall forward.</p>
   <p>The first I notice after five seconds is that my face is not flattened. My nose is less than an inch away from the ground. My blurred eyes only see red.Suddenly I am being yanked upwards and backwards as though time was reversing itself.</p>
   <p>The neck of my shirt feels looser, and the next thing I know is that there are rough hands digging into my skin hard enough to leave imprints.I am spun around. I am face to face with sharp jawlines, sparkly white fangs,and breath that reeked of rotten eggs.</p>
   <p>I stare lazily at the lips in action. The words I hear are, "I am going to enjoy taking you apart. I am going to drain you until you're higher than Jesus on the very first Easter, and then I am going to taste every inch of you.</p>
   <p>"It's time to dance, monkey," is spoken to me after a painfully long pause. Those are the last words I hear before everything goes dark.</p>
